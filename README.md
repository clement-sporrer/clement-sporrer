# Clément Sporrer

Product-oriented builder at the intersection of technology, data, and strategy.  
Background in business and financial analytics. Focused on turning complex problems into scalable, decision-oriented systems.

## Current Focus

Designing and building data-driven products that:
- structure information,
- automate workflows,
- and support better, more systematic decision-making.

My work deliberately sits between four pillars:

- **Product design**  
  User needs, clarity, adoption, decision framing

- **Business logic**  
  Processes, incentives, constraints, trade-offs

- **Data analysis**  
  Structuring data, identifying patterns, surfacing decision options

- **Technical execution**  
  From prototype to production, with real-world constraints

I am particularly interested in embedding data directly into products to inform decisions, guide iteration, uncover trends, and optimize trade-offs around time, performance, and resource allocation.
