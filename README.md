# Hi there, I'm Clement Sporrer 👋

Builder at the intersection of **technology, data, and strategy**, with a strong product mindset.
Background in business and financial analytics, focused on turning complex problems into scalable, decision-oriented systems.

## 🎯 Current Focus

Designing and building **data-driven products** that structure information, automate workflows, and support better decision-making.

My work sits deliberately between four pillars:
- product design (user needs, clarity, adoption)
- business logic (processes, incentives, trade-offs)
- data analysis (structuring data, identifying patterns, surfacing decision options)
- technical execution (from prototype to production)

I am particularly interested in embedding data directly into products to inform decisions, guide iteration, uncover trends, and optimize trade-offs around time, performance, and resource allocation.
